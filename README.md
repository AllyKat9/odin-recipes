# odin-recipes

This Current Project is a BASIC HTML RECIPES WEBSITE.

This project is my 1st in the Odin Project's Foundtions course. It comes after I have learned to: make a basic html boilerplate both on text editor and VS Code, learned basic sytax [elements, tags and attributes], safely link external web pages, link my own html  pages, to link images on my webpage.

This project will proove that I understood these HTML basics enough to create a real product. The focus so far isn't on presentation, as we haven't gotten to CSS and Javascript yet, but on getting the basics down.
