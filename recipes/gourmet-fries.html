    <h3 style="background-color: green;">Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley (optional garnish)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parmesan shaker cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parmesan (optional garnish)</li>
        <li>Choice of oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="background-color: forestgreen;">Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Slice your potatoes into a French fry shape (into sticks) then soak in a large bowl of water for at least two hours and as long as overnight. After they’ve soaked, put them in a strainer and rinse them off a bit. Then lay them out on a paper-towel lined sheet pan to dry.</li>
        <li>Finely dice your garlic. </li>
        <li>Chop your parsley, if using for the garnish. </li>
        <li><b>THE FIRST FRY.</b> Heat your oil to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. How much peanut oil is tricky since I don’t know if you will be using a pot or a pan to cook your fries. I used a fairly deep sauce pan and had about an inch of oil in there. Use your best judgment here. Once the oil is ready, start (carefully) adding your fries. Three large russets made a lot of fries so I cooked mine in two batches. Cook the fries for 4 minutes, then remove them from the pan and put on a wire rack on top of a sheet pan. At this point, the potato should be tender, but no browning on the outside. </li>
        <li>Let the fries sit out on the wire rack for 30 minutes before you start the second fry.</li>
        <li><b>THE SECOND FRY.</b> Heat the oil to 350 degrees for the second fry. We want to get these fries nice and crispy. Cook them in batches again for 4-5 minutes per batch until they are golden brown. Once cooked, lay them back on the wire rack on top of sheet pan and salt to your taste.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small pan and cook the garlic for a minute or two, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Put all your hot fries in a large mixing bowl. Pour the butter and garlic on them and give a good toss around the bowl. Add your parmesan shaker cheese here. To make things extra fancy, serve on a platter with fresh grated parmesan and chopped parsley to garnish. Serve IMMEDIATELY. Really. There’s a shelf life. They must be eaten right away.</li>
    </ol>
